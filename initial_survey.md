# Learning Machine Learning - Survey on Mathematics Background

Welcome, and thank you for participating in this research! This study investigates how prior mathematics knowledge influences learning outcomes when students are introduced to foundational machine learning (ML) topics.
You will be asked to provide information about your past maths-related coursework and activities by asking you questions about your experience and with mathematics questions. Afterwards, you can continue with the tutorials for the ML topics. After you study it and become familiar with it, we will test your learning outcome with a set of quiz in Week 7. The information you provide in this form, combined with quiz results, will help us analyze trends across students with different academic backgrounds.

**Important Notes:**
- Participation is entirely voluntary, and you may withdraw at any time.
- Your responses will remain anonymous, and no personal identifiers will be collected.
- Data will be used only for academic purposes and published in aggregated form in a master’s thesis and the university repository.
- Please answer the questions honestly to ensure the reliability of the research.

### 1. Do you agree to participate in this research, knowing that your responses will remain anonymous and be used only for academic purposes?
- Yes
- No

### 2. Please generate your unique participant id using the following formula: Your favorite color + favorite dessert + favorite animal.(e.g. Orange Stroopwafel Cat) Please remember this id, as you will use it again for the quiz in Week 7.
